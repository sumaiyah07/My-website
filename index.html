        <div> <h1> Blog </h1> <h2> My Internship Experince </h2></div>
<div> <h2> </h2> <p> What I learned? This experience has taught me coding is not that bad sure at first it seems complicated a whole new language and terms but with time it gets easier and even fun. I think i will continue coding and even consider maybe working in the field. It was fascinating learning all the mechanics behind a website and gave a greater appreciation . Also learning what a software engineer does and the amount of different people it takes to  run a website from  to agile coach that make sure organisation and communication in a group that communicates with to a full stack engineers that have extensive knowledge of programming languages,software development and computer operating systems,and they take engineering principles to software and user experience that design many more it showed me there are  many careers and paths to choose from. Learning that problem solving seems to be a fundamental skill needed for working in I.T no matter  what your job. Being in the right mind space for working with people and communication using your talents and strengths. In conclusionMy experience at Cazoo has been . My view on computer science as a whole has changed. Coding has become quite interesting to me and i would love to explore it further. Prior to this , i believed computer science to be something that is complicated and hard to understand. Now i am more confident and believe that i can achieve more work to do with coding . Thank you for this opportunity and i wish to be able to continue to learn and code
